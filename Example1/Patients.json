    "medicalNote": "Many years later, and after I was born, when we lived peacefully in Calcutta as the Baktarmitrans, we came across many people with their names beginning with Bhakta, and my name-concious father felt that if he changed the spelling of his name, just a wee bit, to Bhaktamitran from Baktarmitran, he would at least share the beginning of his name with others. So it was that by the time our family left Calcutta, when I was eight, we were the Bhaktamitrans. Bhatkta was a known name and Mitran was a known name. Still, we were the only ones on the planet with this compound name, and with no male heir, the name was doomed to blaze across the sky like a shooting star and fizzle out in due course",
